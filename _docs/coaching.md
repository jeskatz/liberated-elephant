title: Liberated Elephant - Coaching
---

Coaching is a partnership. It’s a relationship which allows an individual, team, or organization to move towards their goals in alignment with who they are and where they want to go.  As a coach, Jessica provides the questions, homework, and space to help her clients find their own results. She can be a sounding board and thought partner or a quiet listener to a client sorting  out his or her own problem. Coaching also provides a safe space for a client to bring his or her whole self to Jessica without fear of judgement or shaming.

Jessica’s coaching is guided by these five core principles:

Truth Tempered with Compassion 
This principle is built on the awareness that truth is built from perspective and that one’s personal truth may not match another’s truth.  I acknowledge that this is the client’s journey, not mine. In so doing, I search to understand and grasp the client’s story in full and to provide my perspectives with compassion and empathy.

Mindfulness
Mindfulness is about remaining self aware and others aware.  Taking right action but not trying to “be right”.  Being mindful of behavior, thought, and speech.  Remaining centered and in service to those I coach.  

Liberate the Elephants
Elephants in the room have important things to share and reflect about us and the system(s) we’re in. Acknowledging them and talking about them fearlessly can liberate them from their confines and make it possible to maximize the strengths in the individual or system.

Embrace the Power of “And”
It is easy to see only two options, thus limiting ourselves to this OR that. The spirit of this principle is to ask, “Why not both,?” “What if,?” and “What else?.” It is in these questions that the client’s creative vision can find life and open new doors.

Active Seeing 
There is power in seeing and being seen.  To this end I vulnerably bring my whole self to my coach session.  My intention is to make it possible for the client to bring their whole self and in so doing reach new possibilities within.
