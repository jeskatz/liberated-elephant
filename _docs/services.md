title: Liberated Elephant - Services
---

Corporations and their employees are at the beginning of a culture shift from profit to purpose. As companies, teams, and individuals begin to make this transition, they are often faced with unspoken barriers. These barriers are usually known or sensed and are often called the elephant in the room. Those elephants remove a sense of psychological safety in working environments.

At Liberated Elephant, our vision is that all Elephants can be acknowledged and transformed. That all work environments can be made psychologically safe. That all employees can be fully engaged and creatively solve difficult problems. 

In line with this vision, Liberated Elephant offers the following services designed to align with client goals: 
Agile implementations and transformations 
Individual, Team, Leadership and Executive coaching 
Intentional culture design and implementation 
Team Building and culture change
